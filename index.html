            <p>Come explore California’s beautiful wilderness.
              Always open. Reservations are not available or required to enter the park.</p>
            <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of 
                granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.

            <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, 
                you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more. </p>
